Learn To Think Like A Computer Scientist. Master the fundamentals of the design and analysis of algorithms.
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth.  This specialization is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience.  The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details.  After completing this specialization, you will be well-positioned to ace your technical interviews and speak fluently about algorithms with other programmers and computer scientists.

About the instructor: Tim Roughgarden has been a professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University since 2004.  He has taught and published extensively on the subject of algorithms and their applications.

Applied Learning Project

Learners will practice and master the fundamentals of algorithms through several types of assessments.  Every week, there is a multiple choice quiz to test your understanding of the most important concepts.  There are also weekly programming assignments, where you implement one of the algorithms covered in lecture in a programming language of your choosing.  Each course concludes with a multiple-choice final exam.
